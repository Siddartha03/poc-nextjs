Architecture and Implementation Details
Here's how this implementation works:

Server Components and API Calls:

All API calls happen server-side in either:

The page component (for initial data)
Server actions (for subsequent data fetching)

This ensures API calls are not visible in the browser network tab

Client Components:

Three client components as requested:

FamilyProcessSelection: Displays two dropdowns for family and process selection
HierarchyList: Displays the heirarchy tree using Ant Design's Tree component
HierarchyContent: Displays detailed content for a selected node

Data Flow:

Initial data (families and processes) is fetched server-side and passed to client components
When selections are made, server actions are called
React 19's useTransition hook is used for loading states

Security:

All API endpoints use POST method where appropriate with proper validation
No query parameters or client-side API calls are used
No state management libraries are used as requested

React 19 Features:

Uses latest React 19 hooks including useTransition for loading states
Uses the new React Server Components pattern

With this implementation, the user flow works as follows:

User selects a family from the first dropdown
User selects a process from the second dropdown
Upon process selection, a heirarchy tree is displayed
When the user clicks on a node in the tree, detailed content for that node is displayed

All API calls happen on the server-side, ensuring they won't appear in the browser's network tab, fulfilling your security requirement.

Next.js Server Action communication mechanism.
When you use Server Actions in Next.js 15 with React 19, the client component still needs to communicate with the server to execute those server actions. This communication appears in the network tab, but it's not your direct API calls - it's the Next.js framework's way of invoking server functions from the client.
